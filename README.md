# Nichenametla-Naga-Sushwar-21BKT0182

This project consists of a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Setup and Running

### Client (React)

1. Navigate to the client directory:
   cd client

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the React development server:
   npm start

   The client will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).

### Server (Node.js)

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   cd server

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Start the Node.js server using nodemon:
   nodemon app.js

   The server will start and listen for requests (typically on http://localhost:4000).

## Development

For development, you'll need to run both the client and server concurrently. Open two terminal windows, navigate to the respective directories, and run the start commands for each.

## Additional Information

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Check the package.json files in both client and server directories for specific dependencies and scripts.
- Update environment variables or configuration files as needed for your development setup.
